# Investing Book

This is my a interactive recording of my quest to become a successful investor.

Contains various code snippets in python and ipython notebooks with useful code snippets to analyze a variety of stocks and stock related data.

My quest to gain an edge on stocks includes

* Scanning for news from yahoo
* Subscribing to ceo.ca to get news alerts
* Python scripts to visualize my yolo purchase decisions
* Sentiment Analysis on published documents and text
* Analyze the transcripts of youtube videos for nlp
* Algorithmic trading - just for back testing
* Price Prediction
* Risk Analyze - I honestly just held enough cash to deploy in any situation.
* Estimation of Returns

But to be perfectly honest, I have done fairly well buying canadian small cap companies that were interesting or undervalued.
