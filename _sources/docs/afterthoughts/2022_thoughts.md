## Initial Thoughts

Although I was somewhat accurate in predicting the prices of bb, all my other predictions were completely wrong.

Note to self dont trust my ability to randomly throw out numbers, focus on big picture changes

## Simple portfolio

Despite losses in PKK, I still belive in the stock.

My simple portfolio for 2022 would consist of mainly ar, fintech, one stable dividend stock.

NTAR: 20%
PKK: 20%
ZIM: 20%
VPH: 20%
DCM: 20%

## DII.B

Dorel is a company that sells a bunch of different things.

They has sold off their biking business and have decided to give a special dividend of $12 USD to shareholders.

I believe with a current price of $15 CAD in a tax free savings account. The value cannot be understated here.

I have until January 17th to buy, and will likely use two or three goes to purchase shares.

A relative of mine thought that DII.B (dorel) was a declining business and overlooked the special dividend, so I think the stock price is greatly undervalued.

"The special dividend will be payable on February 1, 2022 to shareholders of record as at the close of business on January 18, 2022".

With the extra cash I think its unlikely that the stock price would decline more than 50%, they still have other businesses.

With the recent rate hike scare, I should be able to acquire this asset around 24 or lower.

## Plurlock Security

1/16/2022.

As of sept 2021 they are sitting around 7.6 million, losing 1.44 million per quarter.

Can last until 2022.

Seems like a lot of their business is low margin, not really that interesting at the moment.

They are facing supply chain issues and making less on their hardware.

I want to see their software sales go up higher before investing, likely thats why their stock is down.

Not interested in low margin hardware sales while software sales remain flat.

PLUR.V wait and see


## Zim Purchase

Dumped a lot of money into zim.

Jerome Powell mentioned that supply chain shortages should "get" better in the second half of 2022.

Going to hold ZIM in my tsfa and pump and dump based on dividend news releases.

And rebuy in my taxable accounts to avoid the tax on dividends.

I think zim is an excellent buy, supply chain shortages should persist with the great resignation, new lockdowns and bottlenecks like more flooding and disruptions.


## March 2022

Expected to raise rates, but there is a high chance that the fed will delay or take it slow again. Buy the 5 to 10% dip on strong stonks like zim and/or small caps.

* Buy zim in rrsp using new input money after canada does rate stuff on wednesday
* dumped money in hive because crypto is more attractive as russia is cut off from the global financial system
* I expect usage and price to remain around these levels
* dump if price goes up enough

Messed up on hive (russia cant do anything even use cryptocurrency), hold hive for a while, no real use atm.

Tax loss selling

uan, solid company, should perform well with rising food costs and banning of fertilizer, american company, expect it to do well, with 5 dollar dividend.

As for zim, shipping rates should go higher with russia disruption hold until 2022.

- there is a contract coming up in 2022, chance of port strikes are very high
- wait and hold until the port strike in the usa.
- vfv is an etf tracking the S&P 500 I can invest in using canadian dollars.

### Russian Invasion

#### Russia loses

- they run away, or akwardly attempt to broker peace
- most sanctions remain, production has been wiped and investment not happening
- production still messed up

#### Urkaine Wins

- russia keeps fighting for a while
- damaged infrastructure, farmers have evacuated, cant start up production right away
- expect costs to normalize after 2 to 3 years

#### Russia keeps fighting
- prelonged war, urakine not safe
- production hampers, oil prices hit 200 dollars per barrel
- status quo remains
