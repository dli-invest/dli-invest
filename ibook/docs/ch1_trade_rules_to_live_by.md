# Rules for Trading

These are just quotes from legendary investors like Ray Dalio and Warren Buffett, I could rewrite this or take this section out if I publish this book and sell it.

“If you don’t find a way to make money while you sleep, you will work until you die” — Warren Buffet
```

#### Key Thoughts from Intelligent Investor

* A stock is not just a ticker symbol or an electronic blip; it is an
ownership interest in an actual business, with an underlying value
that does not depend on its share price.
* The market is a pendulum that forever swings between unsustainable optimism (which makes stocks too expensive) and unjustified
pessimism (which makes them too cheap). The intelligent investor
is a realist who sells to optimists and buys from pessimists.
* The future value of every investment is a function of its present
price. The higher the price you pay, the lower your return will be.
* No matter how careful you are, the one risk no investor can ever
eliminate is the risk of being wrong. Only by insisting on what
Graham called the "margin of safety"—never overpaying, no matter how exciting an investment seems to be-can you minimize your odds of error.
* The secret to your financial success is inside yourself. If you
become a critical thinker who takes no Wall Street “fact” on faith,
and you invest with patient confidence, you can take steady
advantage of even the worst bear markets. By developing your
discipline and courage, you can refuse to let other people’s mood
swings govern your financial destiny. In the end, how your investments behave is much less important than how you behave.

* how you can minimize the odds of suffering irreversible losses;
* how you can maximize the chances of achieving sustainable gains;
* how you can control the self-defeating behavior that keeps most investors from reaching their full potential.

#### Takeways from debt crisis
The easing by the Federal Reserve also produced a bull market in stocks that
showed every sign of a classic bubble. I’ll repeat my defining characteristics of
a bubble:

    * Prices are high relative to traditional measures
    * Prices are discounting future rapid price appreciation from these high levels
    * There is broad bullish sentiment
    * Purchases are being financed by high leverage
    * Buyers have made exceptionally extended forward purchases (e.g.,
built inventory, contracted forward purchases, etc.) to speculate or
protect themselves against future price gains.

#### Things to remember when buying stocks



```{caution}
* Margin of safety
* Area of experticity
* Something you understand
```

```{caution}
Never buy a stock immediately after a substantial rise or
sell one immediately after a substantial drop - {cite}`book:233946`.
```

```{note}
Diversification is protection against ignorance. It makes little sense if you know what you are doing - Warren Buffett. 
```

```{tip}
When asked what keeps most individual investors from succeeding, Graham had a concise answer: "The primary cause of failure is that they pay too
much attention to what the stock market is doing currently" {cite}`book:233946`.
```

Among the "few prudent principles" that investors forgot were such market
clichés as "Trees don’t grow to the sky" and “Bulls make money, bears make
money, but pigs get slaughtered.
