* Copy existing google calendar interaction code from repo
* Use best practise to initialize python repo
* Add discord webhook to notify success or failure
* update csv containing captured earnings per week (useful for future trading) - index by id
* use browserstack instead of selenium for visiblity and easier traceback.
