# Predictions

This year I predicted 20% profit, ended up with at least 40%, so doubled my projections.

Expected to make money, back in march, wasn't worried about the virus, however, listened to bad advice and was familiar enough, and/or smart enough to yolo my money.

## Dec 2020

aiming for 75% on my stocks, 

My forever companies (3 or 4 years) should be PKK, MTRX, and maybe IDK (pinetree) went bankrupt/downhill before, I think SI will be smarter the second time around.


## 2021
Fair value IDK 0.75 cents, warrants are like cheating if you get them right. Right to buy stock at price after it goes up a lot.

Peak may be around $5 next year and this was not counting excellent mega news earlier this year. I estimate $7 sometime next year.

As for DCM, it seems to be picking up in price, if they offer dividends in the future, I will hold forever. I think DCM + PKK will be my dividend stocks.

Should hold

IDK
MTRX
PKK
DCM
