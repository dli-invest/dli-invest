## Stock Purchases Thoughts

Going to purchase ART and CMC for my tsfa 2021

Clean Tech is going to do well in CMC, if the Cielo tech is as good as they say, 100 bagger, as for ART, seems like holograms are going to do well.

Could have future lockdowns.

PKK - 10 bagger eoy price 5.00
IDK - 10 bagger eoy price 2.30
BEE - eoy price 0.80
CMC - 0.30
BB - 12
N - 0.39
PYR - 7
NTAR - 10
DCM - 2

PKK forever stock, want to hold 20 long term, can add some to tsfa at most 2
IDK can add at most 14 cause selling USD stock


TSX: ADCO, Ad core, adco.v
CSE: CRL, carl data solutions, crl.cn
UBMRF:US, urban immursive
dtst, data storage corporation

**4/4/2021**

Coinbase, buy 3 shares, see where the price goes, holding too much cash.


**8/22/2021**

I believe vst will go to the moon, covalent holdings are much higher than the nav.

The ability to buy more creator.co with shares priced at 1.00 rather compared to current stock price of 0.54.

The water shortage is interesting,

I think water treatment will become more important, with contaminated water 
mud/oil.

Consider investing in [AQUA](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AQUA?p=AQUA&.tsrc=fin-srch).
### Retirement crisis

The retirement crisis will happen because of politicans overpromising and underdelivering.

With biden giving 86 billion to bail out pensions, will likely happen if calfornia pensions go away.

When the crisis happens, taxes will likely go up and/or house prices go down?

I hope that the retirement crisis will be resolved soon


### Evergrande Crisis

I sold most of my pkk the day on 9/18/2021 in fear of a crash and in part because of evergrande.

Sold the rest on 9/20/2021 due to fears of covid 

Also sold POW.TO because it was financials and fear of the crisis.

I expect the market to crash because if evergrande is going to liquidate massive numbers of properties, it will pull the rest of the market down. 

## Covid Crisis Africa version

- shutdown happening again
- covid will overwhelm hospitals
- stay at home economy
- nothing is going to be fixed  

Will arht media succeed, I believe zim stock will do okay with the increased supply chain crisis.
