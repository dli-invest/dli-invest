# Shipping Industry

Our business has historically been seasonal in nature. As a result, our average freight rates have reflected fluctuations in demand for
container shipping services, which affect the volume of cargo carried by our fleet and the freight rates which we charge for the
transport of such cargo. Our income from voyages and related services are typically higher in the third and fourth quarters than the
first and second quarters due to increased shipping of consumer goods from manufacturing centers in Asia to North America in
anticipation of the major holiday period in Western countries. The first quarter is affected by a decrease in consumer spending in
Western countries after the holiday period and reduced manufacturing activities in China and Southeast Asia due to the Chinese
New Year. However, operating expenses such as expenses related to cargo handling, charter hire of vessels, fuel and lubricant
expenses and port expenses are generally not subject to adjustment on a seasonal basis. As a result, seasonality can have an adverse
effect on our business and results of operations.
