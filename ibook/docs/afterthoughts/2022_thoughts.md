## Initial Thoughts

Although I was somewhat accurate in predicting the prices of bb, all my other predictions were completely wrong.

Note to self dont trust my ability to randomly throw out numbers, focus on big picture changes

## Simple portfolio

Despite losses in PKK, I still belive in the stock.

My simple portfolio for 2022 would consist of mainly ar, fintech, one stable dividend stock.

NTAR: 20%
PKK: 20%
ZIM: 20%
VPH: 20%
DCM: 20%
